          <p className="text-darkColor/80 mb-4">
            With 1 year of professional experience as a Full Stack Developer at Thots2IT Technologies (Feb 2024 â€“ Jan 2025), I have built and maintained enterprise-level web applications using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js). My expertise lies in developing clean and efficient REST APIs, building responsive frontends with React and Tailwind CSS, managing data with MongoDB, and handling authentication flows using JWT and Clerk. I&rsquo;ve also worked on integrating Stripe for secure payments, managing CMS content with Sanity, and collaborating with cross-functional teams using Agile methodology. I am passionate about clean code, scalable architecture, test-driven development, and continuously learning new technologies. Outside of coding, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and mentoring junior developers to help them grow in their careers. My goal is to deliver solutions that not only meet business needs but also provide excellent user experiences.

            When I&rsquo;m not coding, you&rsquo;ll find me exploring new tools in the JavaScript ecosystem or researching the latest trends in web development. I&apos;m committed to writing maintainable, performant code and building meaningful digital experiences.
